				<p><b>IMA2 : Usability Testing Report for a language learning app</b></p>
					
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<p> <b>Product description:</b>
					A popular language learning app, Busuu is used by language learners worldwide. The app like its competitors, Duolingo and Babbel, has gained popularity because of its adaptive learning framework with elements of personalization and cultural integration. Busuu can be downloaded on iOS and Android devices. It reminds the learners of their goals and provides feedback on the learner's performance. </p>  
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<p>
					<b>Methodology:</b>
					The app was analyzed based on a usability test to understand how five diverse learners were able to use the app on learnability, errors and satisfaction. Each learner completed three pre-determined tasks - creating an account, finding one language the user likes to learn and changing the language to another language the learner wants to learn. Time and number of clicks per task were noted and a satisfaction questionnaire was administered for understanding and improving the user experience of Busuu as a learning tool and as an educational product.  You can read the full report <a href="IMA2/EME6208_IMA2_Pritha Sharma.docx" target="_blank">here</a>.
				</p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<p> <b>Summary of the results:</b> Busuu is an intuitive application with an engaging user interface that makes language learning simple. Its design features attractive visuals with appropriate fonts and text, making it easy for users to navigate. However, it may be challenging for beginners or older users, so providing clear guidance on how to use the app would be helpful. Including an introductory tutorial and gamification could improve the app. </p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>The app's ability to support multiple languages and switch between them seamlessly received positive feedback, demonstrating its versatility for a wide range of learners across different age groups. Overall, Busuu serves as an excellent tool to inspire and motivate learners to pursue new languages. The instructional videos were particularly valuable in supporting the learning process.</p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<p> <b>Educational value of the usability test:</b> Instructional designers and app developers can only know the true potential and value of their product by viewing it through the eyes of diverse users. The usability test helps us appreciate the need for making educational products truly useful and effective. The instructional process is incomplete without conducting a usability test as it helps identify potential barriers, improve user engagement, and enhance the overall learning experience by addressing real user needs. By incorporating feedback from these tests, designers and developers can refine their designs to maximize the impact and efficiency of the instructional content.</p>
